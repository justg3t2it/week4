#Assignment: 
Give me a program which can turn numerals into string
2 = II 
Roman numerals can follow the following format: 
IC = 99
XVIC = 84


Thoughts: 
We will need a dictionary to reference established roman numeral values 

We will need to implement the roman numeral subtraction rule 

IC = 1 100 = 100 - 1 = 99 

Super bonus: 
Solve original roman numeral formatted numbers without subtraction rule in N(1) time every time

Pseudocode: 

0. What is your input? What if the string is empty? 

1. Initiate and declare keys for roman numeral dictionary 

2. Establish the rules for finding roman numeral output 

input: string 
output: integer value
